## Setup

1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone <TODO: set repo url>
```

2. Open the newly created folder in VS Code

3. Open your terminal <br> When in your terminal, ensure that the Path that is displayed matches the Path of your project! It should look something like this.
```sh
~/dev/projects/react-basic-setup$
```

4. We are using other peoples code now, and to avoid having tons of duplicate code on GitHub. Those other peoples code is not included in this repository, so we have to download that. Simply done by running.
```sh
npm install
```

5. Everything is in place so we can start up a development server.
```sh
npm run dev
```

6. Open up the URL adress logged to the terminal

7. Make some changes to the code, save, and see the webpage update.

## References

Here are a set of links for documentation for the various pieces of our project.
From most to least important.

Critical:

- [React Documentation](https://react.dev/)
<br> Don't recall what something does in React? Check here.

- [NPM Package Registery](https://www.npmjs.com/)
<br> Looking to add a map/webcam/components to your application? Search here.

Important:

- [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/)
<br> Simple project does not need to change how the application is started/built/deployed, but if you wonder have a look over this.

- [NPM Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)
<br> You can get quite far by just knowing how **add**, **remove** and **run** works. More advanced functionality can be found here.

Nice:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
<br> Knowing why you get all these red squiggly lines might not be as important as how to solve them. But you can start here to broaden your knowledge.

## Design System Examples

Here are a couple of example Design Systems from some of the larger actor one can have a look at.
We will not be creating something this big for our project here, they are merely provided for inspiration.
