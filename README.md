## Setup

1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone <TODO: set repo url>
```

2. Open the newly created folder in VS Code

3. Open your terminal <br> When in your terminal, ensure that the Path that is displayed matches the Path of your project! It should look something like this.
```sh
~/dev/projects/react-basic-setup$
```

4. We are using other peoples code now, and to avoid having tons of duplicate code on GitHub. Those other peoples code is not included in this repository, so we have to download that. Simply done by running.
```sh
npm install
```

5. Everything is in place so we can start up a development server.
```sh
npm run dev
```

6. Open up the URL adress logged to the terminal

7. Make some changes to the code, save, and see the webpage update.
